							<h2>Animal health and Environmment </h2>
							<p class="text-justify">
								The possible negative effects on the environment caused by development, industrial or infrastructural projects driven by humans are numerous, with many of them having a direct impact on animal health and behaviour. Examples of these are climate changes, habitat fragmentation and deforestation, pollution, introduction of species (invasive species), environment degradation, and resource depletion, among others. Species abilities to cope with changes in the environment can be explained in a great extent by behavioural plasticity and coping styles (behavioural syndromes), with some species being more successful than others. Behavioural responses can be maladaptive leading to a species decline or appropriate behavioural responses to these novel environments leading to adaptation, but also facilitating species invasions. Behavioural adjustments will depend for example of the animal’s previous experiences, the complexity of the environment, the ability to cope with multiple stressors and their responses to the available cues.

							<h2>Wildlife diseases </h2>
							<p class="text-justify">
							Identifying the cause of wildlife diseases is difficult because rarely can a single factor be identified as responsible, a concept commonly termed the ‘epidemiological triad’. In addition to immune suppression related to exceeded stress responses and pollutant exposure, environmental change can impinge directly on wildlife health and survival and, consequently, affect the viability of their populations in various intricate ways. For example, climate-related shifts in pathogen and host ranges and pathogen spillover from humans and domestic animals can both increase exposure to new diseases. Similarly, changes in habitat size or quality might lead to a reduction in prey population sizes and increased competition for resources, which in turn might augment starvation and lead to disease and/or death. Effects will be further complicated if the genetic makeup of the affected populations has been compromised owing to reduced gene flow or inbreeding, as low levels of genetic diversity tend to be correlated with reduced fitness and lowered evolutionary potential.
