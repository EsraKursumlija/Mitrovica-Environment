							<h2>Human Health and Environment </h2>
							<p class="text-justify">
								The environment affects our health in a variety of ways. The interaction between human health and the environment has been extensively studied and environmental risks have been proven to significantly impact human health, either directly by exposing people to harmful agents, or indirectly, by disrupting life-sustaining ecosystems
							</p>
							<p>
								Although the exact contribution of environmental factors to the development of death and disease cannot be precisely determined, the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that thirteen million deaths annually are attributable to preventable environmental causes [1]. The report also estimates that 24% of the global disease burden (healthy life years lost) and 23% of all deaths (premature mortality) are attributable to environmental factors, with the environmental burden of diseases being 15 times higher in developing countries than in developed countries, due to differences in exposure to environmental risks and access to health care.

							<h2>Chemicals in the Environment </h2>
							<p class="text-justify">
								Humans and animals have always been exposed to chemicals in our environment - natural products in foods, smoke from cooking fires, sewage in drinking water, pesticides from plants. However, the dramatic increases in industrialization over the past three centuries have dramatically changed both the quality and the quantity of human exposures, to both natural and synthetic chemicals. We all know that certain things are bad for us - cigarette smoke, alcohol, lead, ozone (too much - or too little). But what about other substances in our environment such as gasoline fumes, dry cleaning fluids, pesticides, wood smoke, heavy metals? Environmental health risk assessment allows us to identify the potential hazards to human health and understand how serious such problems may be.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is composed of four components: exposure assessment; hazard identification; dose/response assessment; and risk characterization. Risk assessment is the scientific basis for standard setting. However, regulatory decision-making always involves issues other than science. Environmental health threats may come from physical agents, e.g., UV or ionizing radiation, or biologicals, such as mold, insects, bacteria, and viruses, as well as chemicals. Common environmental chemical pollutants include pesticides and herbicides, volatile organics (VOCs) such as benzene, toluene; and chloroform, heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and arsenic; air contaminants such as carbon monoxide, ozone, particulate matter (PM), and second hand smoke; and persistent organic pollutants, such as the dioxins, PCBs, and DDT.
